export populationCountQoI

################## Ready-made `post_processor` builders ##################
#
# These build a `QoI` aimed at `run(T; post_processor=...)`, which stores one row per simulation in
# ModelManager's post-processing sink (see `postProcessingTable`). What distinguishes them from
# `standard_qois.jl` is where the value goes, not what they receive -- every
# measurement function takes a `Simulation` -- and that the sink never calls `reduce`, so a `compute`
# returning a `Dict` of many columns is useful here and not there.
#
# The sink names a spread column `"<qoi name>.<key>"`, so the key carries the
# cell type alone and the QoI's name supplies the rest.
#

    populationCountQoI(; index::Union{Integer,Symbol}=:final, cell_types=nothing, include_dead::Bool=false)

Return a [`QoI`](@ref ModelManager.QoI) that records per-cell-type population counts.

Reads the snapshot at `index` — `:final` (default), `:initial`, or an integer snapshot
index — via [`PhysiCellSnapshot`](@ref) and [`populationCount`](@ref). Each cell type becomes
one entry keyed by its name, stored by [`run`](@ref ModelManager.run) in the post-processing
sink under the column `population_count.<cell_type>` (e.g. `population_count.default`) and
readable back with [`postProcessingTable`](@ref) or `simulationsTable(...; post_processing=true)`.

If the requested snapshot doesn't exist (e.g. it was pruned), `compute` returns `nothing` and
nothing is recorded for that simulation rather than throwing.

One QoI covers every cell type: they are read from the simulation's own output and so are not known
until it has run, and ModelManager expands a `Dict` return into one column per key.

**This QoI defines no `reduce`, so it is for the sink only.** The sink never reduces — it fires once
per simulation — but every other consumer does, and the default `mean` cannot combine a vector of
`Dict`s. Use [`endpointPopulationCountQoI`](@ref) for calibration; it measures the same thing and
carries a reducer.

# Arguments
- `index`: Which snapshot to count — `:final`, `:initial`, or an integer snapshot index.
- `cell_types`: Optional `Vector{String}` to restrict which cell types are recorded.
  If `nothing`, all cell types present in the simulation are included.
- `include_dead`: Whether to include dead cells in the count (default `false`).

# Examples
```julia
run(sampling; post_processor = populationCountQoI())                       # final counts
run(sampling; post_processor = populationCountQoI(; index=0))              # counts at snapshot 0
run(sampling; post_processor = populationCountQoI(; include_dead=true))    # include dead cells
run(sampling; post_processor = populationCountQoI(; cell_types=["tumor"])) # only "tumor"
```

        #! every key in one flat namespace and a prefix was the only thing keeping two QoIs' "tumor"
        #! apart. ModelManager names the column `"<qoi name>.<key>"`, which does that job, so
        #! the prefix would only give `population_count.count_default`.
