# [Best practices](@id best_practices_man)

## Do NOT manually edit files inside `inputs`.
If parameter values need to be changed, use variations as shown in `scripts/GenerateData.jl`.
Let PhysiCellModelManager.jl manage the databases that track simulation parameters.

If you need to change the structure of an input file, e.g., adding a new rule or editing custom code, create an entire new subdirectory within the relevant `inputs` subdirectory.
If you anticipate doing a lot of this, consider using PhysiCell Studio for your first round of model development and refinement. <!-- PhysiCellModelDeveloper.jl could be made to address this though... -->

# Suggested practices

## [Use `createProject` to create a new PCMM project](@id use_create_project)
[`createProject`](@ref) will create a new PCMM project directory with the necessary structure and files.
*Note: This is a distinct folder from a PhysiCell sample project or user project.*
If you do not want the template PhysiCell project copied over, use the keyword argument `template_as_default=false`, i.e.,
```julia-repl
createProject("MyNewProject"; template_as_default=false)
```

## Be slow to delete simulations and scripts.
PhysiCellModelManager.jl tracks simulations in a database and skips re-running ones that already exist — so adding simulations to a script and re-running it (including on an HPC) runs only the new ones. A script thus doubles as a record you can use to reproduce results later.

If you must delete simulations manually — e.g. after an error left a stale database record — use [`deleteSimulations`](@ref) so the database stays consistent.

## On a cluster, set the job's resources and keep the driver alive.
ModelManager asks SLURM for as many CPUs per job as the simulation's `omp_num_threads` (PCMM reports
it through `simulationThreads`), but nothing else: set `time` and `mem` with [`setJobOptions`](@ref)
before the first `run`, since a job
the scheduler kills is only noticed minutes later. The Julia session that called `run` is what
records each job's outcome, so run long campaigns from `tmux`, `nohup`, or a batch job that outlives
them. The [ModelManager HPC manual](https://drbergman-lab.github.io/ModelManager.jl/stable/man/hpc/)
covers submit limits, refused submissions, interrupting a run, and finding a job in `sacct`.

## Use a dedicated Julia environment.
Keep each project's dependencies in its own environment and commit `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml`. See [Julia environments](@ref julia_environments_man).

## Use version control on `inputs` and `scripts` directories.
These two directories plus the PhysiCell version are enough to reproduce a project. `createProject` adds a `.gitignore` in the data directory so the right files are tracked.

## Update PhysiCell between campaigns, not during one.
PhysiCell lives at `PhysiCell/` inside the project, so updating it is a git operation:
```bash
git -C PhysiCell fetch --tags
git -C PhysiCell checkout <tag-or-commit>
```
If you added PhysiCell as a submodule, run `git submodule update --remote PhysiCell` from the project root instead.

PhysiCellModelManager.jl re-reads the PhysiCell version before every compilation, so you do not need to restart Julia. The next `run` recompiles, and the executable is named for the new version, so switching back to a version you have already built does not rebuild. That check happens once per sampling, though, so a single `Trial` spanning several samplings can straddle two PhysiCell versions — finish a campaign before updating.

## Keep the PhysiCell working tree clean.
Uncommitted changes under `PhysiCell/` cannot be pinned to a commit, so the version is recorded with a `-dirty` suffix and the custom code is recompiled on every run. Commit the changes (or stash them): a real commit hash is reproducible, and its build is cached like every other version.
